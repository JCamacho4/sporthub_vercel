          <p>
            We are a group of five Software Engineering students who are
            currently in our third year of studies. We are taking the User
            Interfaces subject, and as part of the course requirements, we have
            decided to create an e-commerce platform called SportHub. Our goal
            is to create an accessible and functional online store for sports
            enthusiasts that offers a wide range of high-quality products.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team consists of five highly motivated individuals who are all
            committed to making SportHub a success. Our team members are Jorge,
            Valentín, Antonio, Pepe, and Pablo. We all come from different
            backgrounds and have different skill sets, which allows us to work
            together effectively and bring a unique perspective to the table.

          <p>
            We decided to use React and SQLite3 as our core technologies for
            this project. React, is utilized for constructing user interfaces.
            SQLite3, on the other hand, is a lightweight database management
            system that is best suited for modest-scale endeavors. This has
            resulted in the development of a platform that is both responsive
            and efficient.
          </p>
          <p>
            Together, we are committed to making SportHub the best possible
            platform for our users. We are excited to continue developing and
            improving our platform, and we hope that you will join us on this
            journey. If you are interested in examining our code or contributing
            to our project, we encourage you to visit our GitHub repository.
